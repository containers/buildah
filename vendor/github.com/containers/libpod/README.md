# libpod - library for running OCI-based containers in Pods

### Latest Version: 0.10.1.3
### Status: Active Development

## What is the scope of this project?

libpod provides a library for applications looking to use the Container Pod concept popularized by Kubernetes.
libpod also contains a tool called podman for managing Pods, Containers, and Container Images.

At a high level, the scope of libpod and podman is the following:

* Support multiple image formats including the existing Docker/OCI image formats.
* Support for multiple means to download images including trust & image verification.
* Container image management (managing image layers, overlay filesystems, etc).
* Full management of container lifecycle
* Support for pods to manage groups of containers together
* Resource isolation of containers and pods.

## What is not in scope for this project?

* Signing and pushing images to various image storages. See [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo/).
* Container Runtimes daemons for working with Kubernetes CRIs. See [CRI-O](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-o). We are working to integrate libpod into CRI-O to share containers and backend code with Podman.

## OCI Projects Plans

The plan is to use OCI projects and best of breed libraries for different aspects:
- Runtime: [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) (or any OCI compliant runtime) and [oci runtime tools](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-tools) to generate the spec
- Images: Image management using [containers/image](https://github.com/containers/image)
- Storage: Container and image storage is managed by [containers/storage](https://github.com/containers/storage)
- Networking: Networking support through use of [CNI](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni)
- Builds: Builds are supported via [Buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah).
- Conmon: [Conmon](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-o) is a tool for monitoring OCI runtimes. It is part of the CRI-O package

## Current Roadmap

1. Python frontend for Varlink API
1. Integrate libpod into CRI-O to replace its existing container management backend
1. Further work on the podman pod command
1. Further improvements on rootless containers
1. In-memory locking to replace file locks

## Buildah and Podman relationship

Buildah and Podman are two complementary Open-source projects that are available on
most Linux platforms and both projects reside at [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
with [Buildah](https://buildah.io) [(GitHub)](https://github.com/containers/buildah) and
[Podman](https://podman.io) [(GitHub)](https://github.com/containers/libpod).  Both Buildah and Podman are
command line tools that work on OCI images and containers.  The two projects
differentiate in their specialization.

Buildah specializes in building OCI images.  Buildah's commands replicate all
of the commands that are found in a Dockerfile. Buildahâ€™s goal is also to
provide a lower level coreutils interface to build images, allowing people to build
containers without requiring a Dockerfile.  The intent with Buildah is to allow other
scripting languages to build container images, without requiring a daemon.

Podman specializes in all of the commands and functions that help you to maintain and modify
OCI images, such as pulling and tagging.  It also allows you to create, run, and maintain those containers
created from those images.

A major difference between Podman and Buildah is their concept of a container.  Podman
allows users to create "traditional containers" where the intent of these containers is
to be long lived.  While Buildah containers are really just created to allow content
to be added back to the container image.   An easy way to think of it is the
`buildah run` command emulates the RUN command in a Dockerfile while the `podman run`
command emulates the `docker run` command in functionality.  Because of this and their underlying
storage differences, you can not see Podman containers from within Buildah or vice versa.

In short Buildah is an efficient way to create OCI images  while Podman allows
you to manage and maintain those images and containers in a production environment using
familiar container cli commands.  For more details, see the
[Container Tools Guide](https://github.com/containers/buildah/tree/master/docs/containertools).
