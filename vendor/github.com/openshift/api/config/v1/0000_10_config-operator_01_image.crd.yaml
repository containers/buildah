      description: Image governs policies related to imagestream imports and runtime
        configuration for external registries. It allows cluster admins to configure
        which registries OpenShift is allowed to import images from, extra CA trust
        bundles for external registries, and policies to blacklist/whitelist registry
        hostnames. When exposing OpenShift's image registry to the public, this also
        lets cluster admins specify the external hostname.
