# buildah-commit "1" "March 2017" "buildah"

## NAME
buildah\-commit - Create an image from a working container.

## SYNOPSIS
**buildah commit** [*options*] *container* *image*

## DESCRIPTION
Writes a new image using the specified container's read-write layer and if it
is based on an image, the layers of that image.  If *image* does not begin
with a registry name component, `localhost` will be added to the name.

## RETURN VALUE
The image ID of the image that was created.  On error, 1 is returned and errno is returned.

## OPTIONS

**--authfile** *path*

Path of the authentication file. Default is ${XDG\_RUNTIME\_DIR}/containers/auth.json, which is set using `podman login`.
If the authorization state is not found there, $HOME/.docker/config.json is checked, which is set using `docker login`.

**--cert-dir** *path*

Use certificates at *path* (\*.crt, \*.cert, \*.key) to connect to the registry.
Default certificates directory is _/etc/containers/certs.d_.

**--creds** *creds*

The [username[:password]] to use to authenticate with the registry if required.
If one or both values are not supplied, a command line prompt will appear and the
value can be entered.  The password is entered without echo.

**--disable-compression, -D**

Don't default to compressing filesystem layers when building the image.

**--format**

Control the format for the image manifest and configuration data.  Recognized
formats include *oci* (OCI image-spec v1.0, the default) and *docker* (version
2, using schema format 2 for the manifest).

Note: You can also override the default format by setting the BUILDAH\_FORMAT
environment variable.  `export BUILDAH_FORMAT=docker`

**--iidfile** *ImageIDfile*

Write the image ID to the file.

**--quiet**

When writing the output image, suppress progress output.

**--rm**
Remove the container and its content after committing it to an image.
Default leaves the container and its content in place.

**--signature-policy**

Pathname of a signature policy file to use.  It is not recommended that this
option be used, as the default behavior of using the system-wide default policy
(frequently */etc/containers/policy.json*) is most often preferred.

**--squash**

Squash all of the new image's layers (including those inherited from a base image) into a single new layer.

**--tls-verify** *bool-value*

Require HTTPS and verify certificates when talking to container registries (defaults to true)

## EXAMPLE

This example saves an image based on the container.
 `buildah commit containerID newImageName`

This example saves an image named newImageName based on the container.
 `buildah commit --rm containerID newImageName`

This example saves an image based on the container disabling compression.
 `buildah commit --disable-compression containerID`

This example saves an image named newImageName based on the container disabling compression.
 `buildah commit --disable-compression containerID newImageName`

This example commits the container to the image on the local registry while turning off tls verification.
 `buildah commit --tls-verify=false containerID docker://localhost:5000/imageId`

This example commits the container to the image on the local registry using credentials and certificates for authentication.
 `buildah commit --cert-dir ~/auth  --tls-verify=true --creds=username:password containerID docker://localhost:5000/imageId`

This example commits the container to the image on the local registry using credentials from the /tmp/auths/myauths.json file and certificates for authentication.
 `buildah commit --authfile /tmp/auths/myauths.json --cert-dir ~/auth  --tls-verify=true --creds=username:password containerID docker://localhost:5000/imageName`

## Files

**registries.conf** (`/etc/containers/registries.conf`)

registries.conf is the configuration file which specifies which container registries should be consulted when completing image names which do not include a registry or domain portion.
