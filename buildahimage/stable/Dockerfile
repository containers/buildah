# Build a Buildah container image from the latest
# stable version of Buildah on the Fedoras Updates System.
# https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?search=buildah
# This image can be used to create a secured container
# that runs safely with privileges within the container.

# Don't include container-selinux and remove
# directories used by dnf that are just taking
# up space.
