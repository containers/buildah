# stablebyhand/Containerfile.buildahstable
#
# Build a Buildah container image from a particular
# stable version of Buildah on the Fedora Updates System.
# https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?search=buildah
# This image can be used to create a secured container
# that runs safely with privileges within the container.
# This Containerfile builds version 1.14.3, the version and
# the RPM name would need to be adjusted before a run as
# appropriate.
#
# To use, 'podman build -f ~/Containerfile.buildahstable -t quay.io/buildah/stable:v1.14.3 .'
#
FROM registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora:latest

# Build a version:  Copy tar file from bohdi to `/root/tmp` then run
# `podman build -t quay.io/stable:v1.14.3 -f ~/Containerfile.buildahstable .`

# Don't include container-selinux and remove directories
# used by yum that are just taking up space.
# Make sure next two lines match the RPM name and version in command.
# Once complete:
# `podman push quay.io/buildah/stable:v1.14.3 docker://quay.io/buildah/stable:v1.14.3`
