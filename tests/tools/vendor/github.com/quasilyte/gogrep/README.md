# gogrep

This is an attempt to move a modified [gogrep](https://github.com/mvdan/gogrep) from the [go-ruleguard](https://github.com/quasilyte/go-ruleguard) project, so it can be used independently.

This repository contains two Go modules. One for the gogrep library and the second one for the command-line tool.

## gogrep as a library

To get a gogrep library module, install the root Go module.

```bash
$ go get github.com/quasilyte/gogrep
```

## gogrep as a command-line utility

To get a gogrep command-line tool, install the `cmd/gogrep` Go submodule.

```bash
$ go install github.com/quasilyte/gogrep/cmd/gogrep@latest
```

See [docs/gogrep_cli.md](_docs/gogrep_cli.md) to learn how to use it.

## Used by

A gogrep library is used by:

* [go-ruleguard](https://github.com/quasilyte/go-ruleguard)
* [gocorpus](https://github.com/quasilyte/gocorpus)

## Acknowledgements
