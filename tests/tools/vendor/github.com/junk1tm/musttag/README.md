A Go linter that enforces field tags in (un)marshaled structs

## ðŸ“Œ About

`musttag` checks that exported fields of a struct passed to a `Marshal`-like function are annotated with the relevant tag:

```go
// BAD:
var user struct {
	Name string
}
data, err := json.Marshal(user)

// GOOD:
var user struct {
	Name string `json:"name"`
}
data, err := json.Marshal(user)
```

The rational from [Uber Style Guide][1]:

> The serialized form of the structure is a contract between different systems.
> Changes to the structure of the serialized form, including field names, break this contract.
> Specifying field names inside tags makes the contract explicit,
> and it guards against accidentally breaking the contract by refactoring or renaming fields.

## ðŸš€ Features

`musttag` supports these packages out of the box:

* `encoding/json`
* `encoding/xml`
* `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`
* `github.com/BurntSushi/toml`
* `github.com/mitchellh/mapstructure`
* ...and any [custom one](#custom-packages)

## ðŸ“¦ Install

### Go

```shell
go install github.com/junk1tm/musttag/cmd/musttag@latest
```

### Brew

```shell
brew install junk1tm/tap/musttag
```

### Manual

Download a prebuilt binary from the [Releases][2] page.

## ðŸ“‹ Usage

As a standalone binary:

```shell
musttag ./...
```

Via `go vet`:

```shell
go vet -vettool=$(which musttag) ./...
```

### Custom packages

The `-fn=name:tag:argpos` flag can be used to report functions from custom packages, where

* `name` is the full name of the function, including the package
* `tag` is the struct tag whose presence should be ensured
* `argpos` is the position of the argument to check

For example, to support the `sqlx.Get` function:

```shell
musttag -fn="github.com/jmoiron/sqlx.Get:db:1" ./...
```
