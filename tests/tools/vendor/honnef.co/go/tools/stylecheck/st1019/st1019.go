		Title: `Importing the same package multiple times`,
		Text: `Go allows importing the same package multiple times, as long as
different import aliases are being used. That is, the following
bit of code is valid:

    import (
        "fmt"
        fumpt "fmt"
        format "fmt"
        _ "fmt"
    )

However, this is very rarely done on purpose. Usually, it is a
sign of code that got refactored, accidentally adding duplicate
import statements. It is also a rarely known feature, which may
contribute to confusion.

Do note that sometimes, this feature may be used
intentionally (see for example
https://github.com/golang/go/commit/3409ce39bfd7584523b7a8c150a310cea92d879d)
â€“ if you want to allow this pattern in your code base, you're
advised to disable this check.`,
